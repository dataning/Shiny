Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web applications (apps) straight from R. This lesson will get you started building Shiny apps right away. "],
["structure.html", "2 Structure", " 2 Structure Shiny apps are contained in a single script called app.R. The structure can be broken into four parts: Shiny package. Load the shiny package in the script first. User interface object. The user interface (ui) object controls the layout and appearance of your app. Server function. The server function contains the instructions that your computer needs to build your app shinyApp function. The shinyApp function creates Shiny app objects from an explicit UI/server pair. The script app.R can be run like a typical R script or run like a app through a folder runApp(&quot;newdir&quot;). This is the way to run R shiny like a typical R object such as plots. # First part, load the package library(shiny) # Second part, define UI for the Shiny app ui &lt;- fluidPage( # App title ---- titlePanel(&quot;Hello Shiny Learner!&quot;), # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ---- sidebarLayout( # Sidebar panel for inputs ---- sidebarPanel( # Input: Slider for the number of bins ---- sliderInput(inputId = &quot;bins&quot;, label = &quot;Number of bins:&quot;, min = 5, max = 50, value = 30) ), # Main panel for displaying outputs ---- mainPanel( # Output: Histogram ---- plotOutput(outputId = &quot;distPlot&quot;) ) ) ) # Third part, define server logic required to draw a histogram server &lt;- function(input, output) { # Histogram of the Old Faithful Geyser Data ---- # with requested number of bins # This expression that generates a histogram is wrapped in a call # to renderPlot to indicate that: # # 1. It is &quot;reactive&quot; and therefore should be automatically # re-executed when inputs (input$bins) change # 2. Its output type is a plot output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlot({ x &lt;- faithful$waiting bins &lt;- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1) hist(x, breaks = bins, col = &quot;#75AADB&quot;, border = &quot;blue&quot;, xlab = &quot;Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)&quot;, main = &quot;Histogram of waiting times&quot;) }) } # Fourth part, tie up ui and server shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) Note: use the keyboard shortcut to run app.R: Command+Shift+Enter (Mac) (Control+Shift+Enter on Windows). The alternative way is to run the R shiny script remotely like a app. This can be achieved by creating a folder called my_app in your current working directory. Then save the R shiny script above into a R script file called app.R in the my_app folder. Then you can open a new R blank script and the R Shiny app should pop up when you run runApp(&quot;my_app&quot;) in the console. runApp is similar to read.csv, read.table, and many other functions in R. The first argument of runApp is the filepath from your working directory to the app’s directory. The code above assumes that the app directory is in your working directory. In this case, the filepath is just the name of the directory. "],

You lay out the user interface of your app by placing elements in the fluidPage function. For example, the ui function below creates a user interface that has a title panel and a sidebar layout, which includes a sidebar panel and a main panel. Note that these elements are placed within the fluidPage function while other Shiny parts remain constant (i.e. server side and linking up). library(shiny) ui &lt;- fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;title panel&quot;), sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel(&quot;sidebar panel&quot;), mainPanel(&quot;main panel&quot;) ) ) # Server side server &lt;- function(input, output) { } # Run the app ---- shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) ## ## Listening on http://127.0.0.1:7750 titlePanel and sidebarLayout are the two most popular elements to add to fluidPage. They create a basic Shiny app with a sidebar. The sidebar panel will appear on the left side of your app by default. You can move it to the right side by giving sidebarLayout the optional argument position = &quot;right&quot;. sidebarLayout always takes two arguments: - sidebarPanel function output - mainPanel function output # Package library(shiny) # Layout ui &lt;- fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;Bradford Data Education&quot;), sidebarLayout(position = &quot;right&quot;, # default is on the left sidebarPanel( sliderInput( &quot;obs&quot;, &quot;Number of observations:&quot;, min = 1, max = 1000, value = 600) ), mainPanel(plotOutput(&quot;distPlot&quot;) ) ) ) # Server server &lt;- function(input, output) { } # Tie shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) ## ## Listening on http://127.0.0.1:7261 # Package library(shiny) # Layout ui &lt;- fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;My Star Wars App&quot;), sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel(), mainPanel( h6(&quot;Episode IV&quot;, align = &quot;center&quot;), h6(&quot;A NEW HOPE&quot;, align = &quot;center&quot;), h5(&quot;It is a period of civil war.&quot;, align = &quot;center&quot;), h4(&quot;Rebel spaceships, striking&quot;, align = &quot;center&quot;), h3(&quot;from a hidden base, have won&quot;, align = &quot;center&quot;), h2(&quot;their first victory against the&quot;, align = &quot;center&quot;), h1(&quot;evil Galactic Empire.&quot;) ) ) ) # Server server &lt;- function(input, output) { } # Tie shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server) ## ## Listening on http://127.0.0.1:5456 # Package library(shiny) # ui ui &lt;- fluidPage( titlePanel(&quot;My Shiny App&quot;), sidebarLayout( sidebarPanel(), mainPanel( p(&quot;p creates a paragraph of text.&quot;), p(&quot;A new p() command starts a new paragraph.
