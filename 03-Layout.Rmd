# Application layout guide

Shiny includes a number of facilities for laying out the components of an application. This guide describes the following application layout features:

- The simple default layout with a sidebar for inputs and a large main area for output.

- Custom application layouts using the Shiny grid layout system.

- Segmenting layouts using the tabsetPanel() and navlistPanel() functions.

- Creating applications with multiple top-level components using the navbarPage() function.

These features were implemented using the layout features available in Bootstrap 2, an extremely popular HTML/CSS framework (though no prior experience with Bootstrap is assumed).

> This means that `Bootstrap2` is a potentially good look-into language.
