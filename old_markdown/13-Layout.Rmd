# Application layout guide

Shiny includes a number of facilities for laying out the components of an application. This guide describes the following application layout features:

- The simple default layout with a sidebar for inputs and a large main area for output.

- Custom application layouts using the Shiny grid layout system.

- Segmenting layouts using the tabsetPanel() and navlistPanel() functions.

- Creating applications with multiple top-level components using the navbarPage() function.

These features were implemented using the layout features available in Bootstrap 2, an extremely popular HTML/CSS framework (though no prior experience with Bootstrap is assumed).

> This means that `Bootstrap2` is a potentially good look-into language.

## Standard one

![](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/images/01_hello.png)


This is the 
```{r}
library(shiny)

# Second part, define UI for the Shiny app
ui <- fluidPage(
  # App title ----
  titlePanel("Hello Shiny Learner!"),
  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----
  sidebarLayout(position = "right", 
    # Sidebar panel for inputs ----
    sidebarPanel(
      # Input: Slider for the number of bins ----
      sliderInput(inputId = "bins",
                  label = "Number of bins:",
                  min = 5,
                  max = 50,
                  value = 30)
    ),
    # Main panel for displaying outputs ----
    mainPanel(
      # Output: Histogram ----
      plotOutput(outputId = "distPlot")
    )
  )
)

# Third part, define server logic required to draw a histogram
server <- function(input, output) {
  
  # Histogram of the Old Faithful Geyser Data ----
  # with requested number of bins
  # This expression that generates a histogram is wrapped in a call
  # to renderPlot to indicate that:
  #
  # 1. It is "reactive" and therefore should be automatically
  #    re-executed when inputs (input$bins) change
  # 2. Its output type is a plot
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    x    <- faithful$waiting
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = "#75AADB", border = "orange",
         xlab = "Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)",
         main = "Histogram of waiting times")
  })
}

# Fourth part, tie up ui and server
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

# Grid Layout

The familiar sidebarLayout() described above makes use of Shinyâ€™s lower-level grid layout functions. Rows are created by the fluidRow() function and include columns defined by the column() function. Column widths are based on the Bootstrap 12-wide grid system, so should add up to 12 within a fluidRow() container.
